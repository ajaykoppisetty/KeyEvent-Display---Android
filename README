Description
	Once, I was playing with a number of Chinese tablets and trying different ROMs on them as they are technically the same hardware (HSG X5A variants).

	I've had some problems getting the hard buttons to work though, so I wrote this application to detect key events and print them out.

	The three checkboxes at the top control what information will be displayed.

    KeyEvents: The KeyEvents as Android understands them (KeyUp, KeyDown, KeyLongPress, KeyMultiple).
    LogCat: Any relevant messages in logcat. Its filtered based on keywords declared in arrays.xml
    Kernel: Any relevant messages in the kernel log. Its filtered based on keywords declared in arrays.xml

	(Kernel log parsing needs root)
	
	This is a personal debug tool, but I hope it will be of some use to someone else.

	No Ads.
	
Notes
    While the application is running, the only "hard" keys which should work is "Home" and power. All others will produce their keycodes.\n
    
    The SU request is to read the kernel log, so I can check if any keyevents are thrown by the kernel.
    
    The location of keylayout files in Android is "/system/usr/keylayout".
    
    Kernel log parsing needs root
    
    Both logcat and kernel log monitoring will only display lines containing words from two arrays in arrays.xml
    
	Currently the filters are:
		Logcat:
			HwGPIOE->GPDA
			keycode
			keycharacter
		Kernel:
			HwGPIOE->GPDA
			keycode
			keycharacter
    
    <string-array name="logcat_filter">
        <item>HwGPIOE->GPDA</item>
        <item>keycode</item>
        <item>keycharacter</item>
    </string-array>
